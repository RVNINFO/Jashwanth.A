        The Amazon Rainforest, spanning over 5.5 million square kilometers, plays a crucial role in regulating the Earth's climate. 
        Often referred to as the "lungs of the Earth", it absorbs vast amounts of carbon dioxide and produces 20% of our planet's oxygen. 
        Recent satellite data, however, reveals that deforestation has surged by 22% in the past year alone. Illegal logging and mining continue to threaten biodiversity.
        Indigenous communities are calling for international environmental interventions.

        The Ganges River, one of the holiest and most essential rivers in India, provides water to over 400 million people. 
        A recent environmental survey highlighted increased levels of industrial pollutants and untreated sewage. 
        Despite several clean-up initiatives like "Namami Gange", experts warn that urbanization without adequate infrastructure continues to degrade the river's health. 
        Citizens and NGOs are pushing for stricter enforcement of water treatment laws.

        The Himalayan mountain range, home to Mount Everest and over 50 other peaks above 7,000 meters, is undergoing rapid change. 
        Glaciologists report that glaciers are melting at double the rate compared to the previous century, driven by climate change. 
        This directly affects water supply to nations downstream, including India, Nepal, Bhutan, and China. 
        The loss of glacial mass also increases the risk of flash floods and landslides, especially during monsoon season.

        A joint NASA-ESA study recently highlighted significant improvements in urban air quality during the COVID-19 lockdowns, particularly in cities like Delhi, Beijing, and Milan. 
        As global traffic came to a standstill, nitrogen dioxide levels in the atmosphere fell by over 30%. 
        The visible blueness of the skies reminded city dwellers of whatâ€™s possible with reduced emissions. 
        Policymakers are now considering permanent changes like electric public transport and vehicle-free zones.

        Oceans cover 71% of the Earthâ€™s surface and are critical for regulating weather, absorbing heat, and sustaining marine life. 
        Scientists now warn that the oceans have absorbed over 90% of the excess heat from global warming, leading to mass coral bleaching, especially in the Great Barrier Reef. 
        Additionally, rising sea temperatures disrupt fish migration patterns and food chains, threatening food security in coastal regions. 
        The UN Ocean Decade (2021â€“2030) aims to address these challenges with scientific and policy-driven action.
